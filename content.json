They are looking to migrate to AWS S3 and to store their data in buckets. Each bucket will be named after their individual customers, followed by a random series of letters and numbers. Once written to S3 the data is rarely changed, as it has already been sent to the end customer for them to use as they see fit. However on some occassions, customers may need certain files updated quickly, and this may be for work that has been done months or even years ago. You would need to be able to access this data immediately to make changes in that case, but you must also keep your storage costs extremely low. The data is not easily reproducible if lost. Which S3 storage class should you choose to minimise costs and to maximise retrieval times? S3-IAYou work for a health insurance company who collects large amounts of documents regarding patients health records. This data will be used usually only once when assessing a customer and will then need to be securely stored for a period of 7 years. In some rare cases you may need to retrieve this data within 24 hours of a claim being lodged. Which storage solution would best suit this scenario? You need to keep your costs as low as possible. Glacier.You run a popular photo sharing website that is based off S3. You generate revenue from your website via paid for adverts, however you have discovered that other websites are linking directly to the images on your site, and not to the HTML pages that serve the content. This means that people are not seeing your adverts and every time a request is made to S3 to serve an image it is costing your business money. How could you resolve this issue? use signed urls with expire datesRRSAmazon S3 Reduced Redundancy StorageReduced Redundancy Storage (RRS) is an Amazon S3 storage option that enables customers to store noncritical, reproducible data at lower levels of redundancy than Amazon S3’s standard storage. It provides a highly available solution for distributing or sharing content that is durably stored elsewhere, or for storing thumbnails, transcoded media, or other processed data that can be easily reproduced. The RRS option stores objects on multiple devices across multiple facilities, providing 400 times the durability of a typical disk drive, but does not replicate objects as many times as standard Amazon S3 storage.Reduced Redundancy Storage is:Backed with the Amazon S3 Service Level Agreement for availability. Designed to provide **99.99% durability and 99.99% availability** of objects over a given year. This durability level corresponds to an average annual expected loss of 0.01% of objects. Designed to sustain the loss of data in a single facility.","link":"/note-0-2018-12-10.html"},{"title":"AWS认证准备-a Cloud Guru笔记 4, Cloud Watch and Monitoring","text":"Cloud Watchdashboardsalarm, notify you when threholds are hitevents, help you to response to state changeslogs, help you to aggregate, monitor and store logsTipsstandard monitoring, 5 mindetailed, 1 mincloud watch is for logging and monitoring (performance …), cloud trail is for auditing (for all activities of your aws account)","link":"/note-3-2018-12-10.html"}],"tags":[{"name":"博客","slug":"博客","link":"/tags/博客/"},{"name":"AWS","slug":"AWS","link":"/tags/AWS/"},{"name":"站点通告","slug":"站点通告","link":"/tags/站点通告/"},{"name":"备考","slug":"备考","link":"/tags/备考/"},{"name":"AWS教程","slug":"AWS教程","link":"/tags/AWS教程/"},{"name":"Solution Architect","slug":"Solution-Architect","link":"/tags/Solution-Architect/"},{"name":"EC2","slug":"EC2","link":"/tags/EC2/"},{"name":"EBS","slug":"EBS","link":"/tags/EBS/"},{"name":"Pricing","slug":"Pricing","link":"/tags/Pricing/"},{"name":"IAM","slug":"IAM","link":"/tags/IAM/"},{"name":"S3","slug":"S3","link":"/tags/S3/"},{"name":"ELB","slug":"ELB","link":"/tags/ELB/"}],"categories":[{"name":"备考","slug":"备考","link":"/categories/备考/"},{"name":"AWS架构","slug":"AWS架构","link":"/categories/AWS架构/"},{"name":"资源","slug":"资源","link":"/categories/资源/"},{"name":"笔记","slug":"笔记","link":"/categories/笔记/"}]}
